Met with the group to plan some next steps. Have a meeting with Teddi at 2, so formed some questions we have for her. I am curious if she is going to recommend using webpack instead of Next.js, so will be looking into configuring webpack until our meeting.

#### Actions Taken
Meeting went well. Going to proceed with using Next.

#### Challenge/Motivation
Need to learn more about server side rendering vs client side rendering.

#### Actions Taken
Tomorrows first action item is to look into this. I have a basic understanding, but need to understand more about how this affects routes.

#### Results Observed
For a while I have been reminding myself to find a way to love this type of work. And it is starting to get easier and easier. Looking learning these new technologies and excited to continue working with and on them to progress myself as an engineer.
