## Overview
Today was the first day of the project.  We spent the morning getting oriented with what the project entails. After that we broke into groups. We made a trello board for our project.

#### Challenge/Motivation
As of right now, there are no challenges. But I know there will be plenty to come...

#### Actions Taken
After we got our repo set up and file system drawn up, we decided to focus on learning about the differences between Material UI and bootstap, as well as familiarizing ourselves with Next.js to see if that's something that we want to use. I think that we will end up using it. It seems like it makes bundling and configuring files very quick and easy. And even tho we are working on a single page app, it has very cool features and I look forward to using it in the future.

#### Results Observed
It is always amazing to me to see all the different ways there are to achieve the same goal with coding. I look forward to seeing how each group approaches this project and the different outcomes.
