#### Challenge/Motivation
I have my widget set up to the point where I like the layout and the styling, so it is time to get all the functionality up to speed. First thing, I did not make my code DRY. It is rendering from the API but in a very disorganized way. I need to refactor about 100 lines down into less than 50 is the goal.

Also want to start working with the accordion feature which I have never used before. I don't imagine it will be too difficult, mainly a toggle that will change the number of questions and answers displayed.
