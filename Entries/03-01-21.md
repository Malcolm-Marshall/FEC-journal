## Overview
Weekend recap.

## Log
### 11:35 AM
#### Challenge/Motivation
We had the weekend off, but the group decided to follow the typical Saturday structure. I was able to get a good amount of work done. First time diving into react-bootstrap and flexbox. I am a big fan, and am excited to learn more. It takes me a while to get things done since I am just starting, but I can see how powerful of a tool it will be.

#### Actions Taken
There is a lot of work I need to do with using flexbox, so I think my next step is to do more research on flexbox and react-bootstrap so I will be able to use it to its potential.

#### Results Observed
