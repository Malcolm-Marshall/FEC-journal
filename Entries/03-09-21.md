#### Challenge/Motivation
Working on the search component.

#### Actions Taken
Needed to get the functionality of the search bar up and running. In theory shouldn't be too hard, just need to check if the characters typed in the bar are included in the question body. The challenge is not triggering too many re renders when live searching. Continuing to work on this today. I ended up moving my axios GET request to my most parent component, hopefully today that will solve the re rendering problem.

#### Results Observed
I like having the GET request at the top most level, and I wish that I had done that sooner. Need to be better about planning data flow.
